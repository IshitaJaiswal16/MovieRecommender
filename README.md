# Movie-Recommender

## ðŸ§©Overview
This project aims to demonstrate the movie recommendation algorithms used by major platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime. For educational purposes, the project begins with the most basic algorithms or techniques used in a recommendation, and progressively builds upon them to implement more advanced and sophisticated techniques. Finally, the project will enable a user to get movie recommendations through content-based filtering.

## ðŸš€ How it works
The model suggests movies based upon the movie you choose. All you need to do is select a movie from the drop down menu and it will recommend you movies that you would enjoy watching.
